### WordleHub
This is a school project to display webaplication and api knowledge!

It's based on React and using ApiNinja's Api to retrieve random words.

We had to choose a library/framework, we choose React the JSX based library that is the most used library for just this kind of programming.
React provides both a virtual DOM and modular components so that programming a game would be easier.
Since the use of game logic needs quite alot of data to be passed around the app.
The big community of react was also the grain of rice that tipped the scale.
Vue and Angular were also considered but since they lack in either regards of modular components or virtual DOM we excluded them and went with react.

### You will need to have access to a terminal and have Node.js installed you will also need to create your own api:key
You will need to create a account at (https://api-ninjas.com/register) then copy your code and paste that into the App.js
When that is done go to the next step.
Clone the code and open it in your prefered terminal run the commands beneth!
